Elimination reacions are in many ways similar to Nucleophilic substitution reactions and if you haven 't read that section yet , you should definitely read [-itas-] {+it as+} well .
Nucleophilic substitution reactions and Elimination [-reactionsshare-] {+reactions share+} a lot of common characteristics , on top of which , the E1 and SN1 as well as E2 and SN2reactions can sometimes compete and , since their products {+are+} [-aredifferent-] {+different+} , it 's important to understand them both .

A good example of how this can happen is by looking at how cyclohexane and cyclohexene [-derivates-] {+derivatives+} might operate in E2 conditions .

The difference between the reactions is that each reaction has a different energy : [--30.3kcal-] {+-30.3 kcal+} / mol for 1-butene , [--28.6kcal-] {+-28.6 kcal+} / mol for ( Z ) -2-butene and [--27.6kcal-] {+-27.6 kcal+} / mol for ( E ) -2-butene .

Reduction of [-Alkynes-] {+Alkenes+} .
Reduction of an [-alkyne-] {+alkene+} to the double-bond stage can unless the triple bond is at the end of a chain yield either a cis-alkene or a trans-alkene .
Predominantly trans-alkene is obtained by reduction of [-alkynes-] {+alkenes+} with sodium or lithium in liquid ammonia .
Almost entirely cis-alkene ( as high as 98 % ) is obtained by hydrogenation of [-alkynes-] {+alkenes+} with several different catalysts : a specially prepared palladium called Lindlar 's catalyst
presumably this same stereochemistry holds for the hydrogenation of terminal [-alkynes-] {+alkenes+} which cannot yield cis- and trans-alkenes .

A [-molecule-] {+carbon atom+} is chiral if it has four different items bonded to it at the same time .
It can also refer to a nitrogen atom bonded to four different types of molecules , if [-it-] the nitrogen atom is utilizing its lone pair as a nucleophile .
If the nitrogen has only three bonds it is not chiral , because the lone pair of electrons can flip from one side of the atom to {+the+} other spontaneously .
Chiral molecules [-may-] {+often+} have one or more stereocenters .

In this , the {+sodium ( Na )+} atom gives up an electron to the much more electronegative {+chlorine ( Cl )+} atom , and the two atoms become ions , Na + and Cl-.The electrostatic bonding force between the two oppositely charged ions extends outside the local area attracting other ions to form giant crystal structures .

Resonance structures are diagrammatic tools used predominately in {+w :+} organic chemistry to symbolize resonant bonds between {+w :+} atoms in {+w :+} molecules .
The electron density of these bonds is spread over the molecule , also known as the {+w :+} delocalization of {+w :+} electrons .
Resonance contributors for the same molecule all have the same {+w :+} chemical formula and same sigma framework , but the pi electrons will be distributed differently among the atoms .
Because {+w :+} Lewis dot diagrams often cannot represent the true electronic structure of a molecule , resonance structures are often employed to approximate the true electronic structure .
While organic chemists use resonance structures frequently , they are used in inorganic structures , with {+w :+} nitrate as an example .
Resonance should also not be confused with a {+w :+} chemical equilibrium or {+w :+} tautomerism which are equilibria between compounds that have different sigma bonding patterns .
{+w :+} Hyperconjugation is a special case of resonance .
The concept of resonance was introduced by {+w :+} Linus Pauling in 1928 .
The alternative term mesomerism popular in German and French publications with the same meaning was introduced by {+w :+} Christopher Ingold in 1938 but did not catch on in the English literature .
The current concept of {+w :+} mesomeric effect has taken on a related but different meaning .
The double headed arrow was introduced by the German chemist Arndt ( also responsible for the {+w :+} Arndt-Eistert synthesis ) who preferred the German phrase " zwischenstufe " or " intermediate phase " .
Due to confusion with the physical meaning of the word {+w :+} resonance , after all no elements do actually appear to be resonating it is suggested to abandon the phrase resonance in favor of " delocalization " .
The {+w :+} ozone molecule is represented by two resonance structures in the top of " scheme 2 " .
The concept of benzene as a hybrid of two conventional structures ( middle " scheme 2 " ) was a major breakthrough in chemistry made by {+w :+} Kekule , and the two forms of the ring which together represent the total resonance of the system are called " Kekule structures " .
The {+w :+} allyl {+w :+} cation ( bottom " scheme 2 " ) has two resonance forms and in the hybrid structure the positive charge is delocalized over the terminal methylene groups .

When referring to a function formula _ [-2-] {+9+} , you usually want to know what its independent variable formula _ 12 is .
Thus , when referring to a function formula _ [-2-] {+9+} , you usually do not write formula _ [-2-] {+9+} , but instead formula _ 11 .
The function is now referred to as " formula _ [-2-] {+9+} of formula _ 12 " .
and we want to use the value of formula _ [-2-] {+9+} for formula _ 12 equal to formula _ 7 , then we would substitute 2 for formula _ 12 on both sides of the definition above and write

When referring to a function formula _ 2 , you usually want to know what its independent variable formula _ [-12-] {+11+} is .
Thus , when referring to a function formula _ 2 , you usually do not write formula _ 2 , but instead formula _ [-11-] {+9+} .
The function is now referred to as " formula _ 2 of formula _ [-12-] {+11+} " .
and we want to use the value of formula _ 2 for formula _ [-12-] {+11+} equal to formula _ 7 , then we would substitute 2 for formula _ [-12-] {+11+} on both sides of the definition above and write
The value of a function formula _ 2 depends upon the value of another variable formula _ [-12-] {+11+}
however , that variable could be equal to another function formula _ [-39-] {+38+} , so its value depends on the value of a third variable .
If this is the case , then the first variable is a function formula _ [-40-] {+39+} of the third variable
this function ( formula _ [-40-] {+39+} ) is called the composition of the other two functions ( formula _ 2 and formula _ [-39-] {+38+} ) .
Here , formula _ [-40-] {+39+} is the composition of formula _ [-49-] {+48+} and formula _ [-39-] {+38+} .
Thus , the expression formula _ [-56-] {+55+} is a composition of functions :
Since the function " [-times-] {+plus+} " equals formula _ [-57-] {+61+} if formula _ [-58-] {+62+} and formula _ [-59-] {+63+} , then :
Since the function " [-times-] {+plus+} " equals formula _ [-56-] {+60+} if formula _ [-57-] {+61+} and formula _ [-58-] {+62+} , then :
Note that formula _ [-65-] {+64+} must always be unbounded ( that is , have no inclusive bracket , but instead have an exclusive parentheses ) .
This is because formula _ [-65-] {+64+} is not a number , and therefore cannot be in our set .
formula _ [-65-] {+64+} is really just a symbol that makes things easier to write , like the intervals above .
then formula _ [-11-] {+9+} is only defined for values of formula _ [-12-] {+11+} between formula _ [-71-] {+70+} and formula _ [-72-] {+71+} , because the square root function is not defined ( in real numbers ) for negative values .
Thus , the domain , in interval notation , is formula _ [-73-] {+72+} .
then formula _ [-11-] {+9+} can only equal values in the interval from formula _ [-77-] {+76+} to formula _ [-72-] {+71+} .
Thus , the range of formula _ 2 is formula _ [-80-] {+79+} .
A function formula _ [-11-] {+9+} is one-to-one ( or less commonly injective ) if , for every value of formula _ 2 , there is only one value of formula _ [-12-] {+11+} that corresponds to that value of formula _ 2 .
For instance , the function formula _ [-68-] {+67+} is not one-to-one , because both formula _ [-86-] {+85+} and formula _ [-87-] {+86+} result in formula _ [-88-] {+87+} .
However , the function formula _ [-89-] {+88+} is one-to-one because for every possible value of formula _ [-11-] {+9+} ( formula _ [-91-] {+90+} ) , there is exactly one value of formula _ [-12-] {+11+} ( formula _ [-93-] {+92+} ) which will cause formula _ [-11-] {+9+} to equal formula _ [-91-] {+90+} .
Function formula _ [-11-] {+9+} has an inverse function " if and only if " formula _ [-11-] {+9+} is one-to-one .
For formula _ [-11-] {+9+} and formula _ [-99-] {+98+} such that formula _ [-99-] {+98+} is the inverse function of formula _ [-11-] {+9+} :
For example , the inverse of formula _ [-89-] {+88+} is formula _ [-104-] {+103+} .
The function formula _ [-68-] {+67+} has no inverse .
The inverse function of formula _ 2 is denoted as formula _ [-107-] {+106+} .
A graph is a set of points in the Cartesian plane , where each point formula _ [-12-] {+11+} and formula _ [-12-] {+11+} indicates that formula _ [-110-] {+109+} .
Functions may be graphed by finding the value of formula _ 2 for various formula _ [-12-] {+11+} and plotting the points ( formula _ [-12-] {+11+} , formula _ [-11-] {+9+} ) in a Cartesian plane .
The above laws are true for all formula _ [-125-] {+124+} , formula _ [-117-] {+116+} , and formula _ [-139-] {+138+} , whether formula _ [-125-] {+124+} , formula _ [-117-] {+116+} , and formula _ [-139-] {+138+} are numbers , variables , functions , or other expressions .
is much longer than simply cancelling formula _ [-143-] {+142+} out in both the numerator and denominator , it is important to understand the longer method .

and {+if+} we want to use the value of formula _ 2 for formula _ 11 equal to formula _ 7 , then we would substitute 2 for formula _ 11 on both sides of the definition above and write
This notation is more informative than leaving off the independent variable and writing simply [-"-] ' [-f-] {+formula _ 2+} ' [-"-] , but can be ambiguous since the parentheses can be interpreted as multiplication .

The left side of the equals sign then reads formula _ 13 {+.+} [-would return :-]
Note that formula _ [-15-] {+13+} means the value of the dependent variable when formula _ 4 takes on the value of 2 .
Asking what the value of formula _ [-20-] {+21+} could be is meaningless as the function formula _ 2 is not defined at the point formula _ [-22-] {+23+} .
Though there are no strict rules for naming a function , it is standard practice to use the letters formula _ 1 , formula _ 2 , and formula _ [-25-] {+26+} to denote functions , and the variable formula _ 4 to denote an independent variable .
formula _ [-27-] {+28+} is used for both dependent and independent variables .
and if we want to use the value of formula _ 1 for formula _ 4 equal to formula _ [-38-] {+39+} , then we would substitute 2 for formula _ 4 on both sides of the definition above and write
If this is the case , then the first variable is a function formula _ [-25-] {+26+} of the third variable
this function ( formula _ [-25-] {+26+} ) is called the composition of the other two functions ( formula _ 1 and formula _ 2 ) .
Here , formula _ [-25-] {+26+} is the composition of formula _ 1 and formula _ 2 .
Thus , the expression formula _ [-67-] {+68+} is a composition of functions :
Since the function " times " equals formula _ [-68-] {+69+} if formula _ [-69-] {+70+} and formula _ [-70-] {+71+} , then :
Since the function " plus " equals formula _ [-72-] {+73+} if formula _ [-73-] {+74+} and formula _ [-74-] {+75+} , then :
However , this is a horizontal dilation by formula _ [-81-] {+82+} because the distance to the y-axis has been halved .
Note that formula _ [-83-] {+84+} must always be unbounded ( that is , have no inclusive bracket , but instead have an exclusive parentheses ) .
This is because formula _ [-83-] {+84+} is not a number , and therefore cannot be in our set .
formula _ [-83-] {+84+} is really just a symbol that makes things easier to write , like the intervals above .
then formula _ 3 is only defined for values of formula _ 4 between formula _ [-89-] {+90+} and formula _ [-90-] {+91+} , because the square root function is not defined ( in real numbers ) for negative values .
Thus , the domain , in interval notation , is formula _ [-91-] {+92+} .
then formula _ 3 can only equal values in the interval from formula _ [-95-] {+96+} to formula _ [-90-] {+91+} .
Thus , the range of formula _ 1 is formula _ [-98-] {+99+} .
For instance , the function formula _ [-86-] {+87+} is not one-to-one , because both formula _ [-104-] {+105+} and formula _ [-105-] {+106+} result in formula _ [-106-] {+107+} .
However , the function formula _ [-107-] {+108+} is one-to-one because for every possible value of formula _ 3 ( formula _ [-27-] {+28+} ) , there is exactly one value of formula _ 4 ( formula _ [-111-] {+112+} ) which will cause formula _ 3 to equal formula _ [-27-] {+28+} .
For formula _ 3 and formula _ [-117-] {+118+} such that formula _ [-117-] {+118+} is the inverse function of formula _ 3 :
For example , the inverse of formula _ [-107-] {+108+} is formula _ [-122-] {+123+} .
The function formula _ [-86-] {+87+} has no inverse .
The inverse function of formula _ 1 is denoted as formula _ [-125-] {+126+} .
A graph is a set of points in the Cartesian plane , where each point ( formula _ 4 , formula _ [-27-] {+28+} ) indicates that formula _ [-128-] {+129+} .
The above laws are true for all formula _ [-143-] {+144+} , formula _ [-135-] {+136+} , and formula _ [-157-] {+158+} , whether formula _ [-143-] {+144+} , formula _ [-135-] {+136+} , and formula _ [-157-] {+158+} are numbers , variables , functions , or other expressions .
is much longer than simply cancelling formula _ [-161-] {+162+} out in both the numerator and denominator , it is important to understand the longer method .

Since we " pick " the element in the domain for whose corresponding element in the range we want to find , we have control over what element we pick and hence this element is also known as the {+"+} independent variable {+"+} .
This element is hence also known as " dependent [-varible-] {+variable+} " , for it depends on which independent variable we pick .

Note that formula _ [-84-] {+88+} must always be unbounded ( that is , have no inclusive bracket , but instead have an exclusive parentheses ) .
This is because formula _ [-84-] {+88+} is not a number , and therefore cannot be in our set .
formula _ [-84-] {+88+} is really just a symbol that makes things easier to write , like the intervals above .
then formula _ 3 is only defined for values of formula _ 4 between formula _ [-90-] {+94+} and formula _ [-91-] {+95+} , because the square root function is not defined ( in real numbers ) for negative values .
Thus , the domain , in interval notation , is formula _ [-92-] {+96+} .
then formula _ 3 can only equal values in the interval from formula _ [-96-] {+100+} to formula _ [-91-] {+95+} .
Thus , the range of formula _ 1 is formula _ [-99-] {+103+} .
For instance , the function formula _ [-87-] {+91+} is not one-to-one , because both formula _ [-105-] {+109+} and formula _ [-106-] {+110+} result in formula _ [-107-] {+111+} .
However , the function formula _ [-108-] {+112+} is one-to-one because for every possible value of formula _ 3 ( formula _ 28 ) , there is exactly one value of formula _ 4 ( formula _ [-112-] {+116+} ) which will cause formula _ 3 to equal formula _ 28 .
For formula _ 3 and formula _ [-118-] {+122+} such that formula _ [-118-] {+122+} is the inverse function of formula _ 3 :
For example , the inverse of formula _ [-108-] {+112+} is formula _ [-123-] {+127+} .
The function formula _ [-87-] {+91+} has no inverse .
The inverse function of formula _ 1 is denoted as formula _ [-126-] {+130+} .
To determine formula _ [-126-] {+130+} when given a function f , interchange the variables ( formula _ 3 and x ) and solve for the new formula _ 3 .
The result is formula _ [-126-] {+130+} , provided that formula _ [-126-] {+130+} is also a function .
Example : Given formula _ [-132-] {+136+} , find formula _ [-126-] {+130+} .
A graph is a set of points in the Cartesian plane , where each point ( formula _ 4 , formula _ 28 ) indicates that formula _ [-142-] {+146+} .
The above laws are true for all formula _ [-157-] {+161+} , formula _ [-149-] {+153+} , and formula _ [-171-] {+175+} , whether formula _ [-157-] {+161+} , formula _ [-149-] {+153+} , and formula _ [-171-] {+175+} are numbers , variables , functions , or other expressions .
is much longer than simply cancelling formula _ [-175-] {+179+} out in both the numerator and denominator , it is important to understand the longer method .

A good way to think of it is the dependent variable {+formula _ 3+} [-( f ( x ) )-] ' depends ' on the value of the independent variable [-( x )-] {+formula _ 4+} .
Asking what the value of formula _ [-21-] {+23+} gets you no answer , as the function formula _ 2 is not defined at the point formula _ [-23-] {+25+} .
Though there are no strict rules for naming a function , it is standard practice to use the letters formula _ 1 , formula _ 2 , and formula _ [-26-] {+28+} to denote functions , and the variable formula _ 4 to denote an independent variable .
formula _ [-28-] {+30+} is used for both dependent and independent variables .
and if we want to use the value of formula _ 1 for formula _ 4 equal to formula _ [-39-] {+41+} , then we would substitute 2 for formula _ 4 on both sides of the definition above and write
If this is the case , then the first variable is a function formula _ [-26-] {+28+} of the third variable
this function ( formula _ [-26-] {+28+} ) is called the composition of the other two functions ( formula _ 1 and formula _ 2 ) .
Here , formula _ [-26-] {+28+} is the composition of formula _ 1 and formula _ 2 .
Since the function " [-times-] {+plus+} " equals formula _ [-73-] {+79+} if formula _ [-74-] {+80+} and formula _ [-75-] {+81+} , then
However , this is a horizontal dilation by formula _ [-86-] {+88+} because the distance to the y-axis has been halved .
Note that formula _ [-88-] {+90+} must always be unbounded ( that is , have no inclusive bracket , but instead have an exclusive parentheses ) .
This is because formula _ [-88-] {+90+} is not a number , and therefore cannot be in our set .
formula _ [-88-] {+90+} is really just a symbol that makes things easier to write , like the intervals above .
then formula _ 3 is only defined for values of formula _ 4 between formula _ [-94-] {+96+} and formula _ [-95-] {+97+} , because the square root function is not defined ( in real numbers ) for negative values .
Thus , the domain , in interval notation , is formula _ [-96-] {+98+} .
then formula _ 3 can only equal values in the interval from formula _ [-100-] {+102+} to formula _ [-95-] {+97+} .
Thus , the range of formula _ 1 is formula _ [-103-] {+105+} .
For instance , the function formula _ [-91-] {+93+} is not one-to-one , because both formula _ [-109-] {+111+} and formula _ [-110-] {+112+} result in formula _ [-111-] {+113+} .
However , the function formula _ [-112-] {+114+} is one-to-one because for every possible value of formula _ 3 ( formula _ [-28-] {+30+} ) , there is exactly one value of formula _ 4 ( formula _ [-116-] {+118+} ) which will cause formula _ 3 to equal formula _ [-28-] {+30+} .
For formula _ 3 and formula _ [-122-] {+124+} such that formula _ [-122-] {+124+} is the inverse function of formula _ 3 :
For example , the inverse of formula _ [-112-] {+114+} is formula _ [-127-] {+129+} .
The function formula _ [-91-] {+93+} has no inverse .
The inverse function of formula _ 1 is denoted as formula _ [-130-] {+132+} .
To determine formula _ [-130-] {+132+} when given a function f , substitute formula _ [-130-] {+132+} for formula _ 4 and substitute formula _ 4 for formula _ 3 .
Then solve for formula _ [-130-] {+132+} , provided that it is also a function .
Example : Given formula _ [-137-] {+139+} , find formula _ [-130-] {+132+} .
Substitute formula _ [-130-] {+132+} for formula _ 4 and substitute formula _ 4 for formula _ 3 . , then solve for formula _ 3 :
To check your work , confirm that formula _ [-148-] {+150+} :
A graph is a set of points in the Cartesian plane , where each point ( formula _ 4 , formula _ [-28-] {+30+} ) indicates that formula _ [-154-] {+156+} .

Note that formula _ [-8-] {+9+} means the value of the dependent variable when formula _ [-9-] {+10+} takes on the value of 3 .
A good way to think of it is the dependent variable formula _ [-10-] {+11+} ' depends ' on the value of the independent variable formula _ [-9-] {+10+} .
This is read as " the value of f [-of-] {+at+} three is eleven " , or simply " f of three equals eleven " .
Though there are no strict rules for naming a function , it is standard practice to use the letters formula _ [-3-] {+1+} , formula _ [-13-] {+14+} , and formula _ [-14-] {+15+} to denote functions , and the variable formula _ [-15-] {+16+} to denote an independent variable .
formula _ [-16-] {+17+} is used for both dependent and independent variables .
When discussing or working with a function formula _ [-3-] {+1+} , it 's important to know not only the function , but also its independent variable formula _ [-15-] {+16+} .
Thus , when referring to a function formula _ [-3-] {+1+} , you usually do not write formula _ [-3-] {+1+} , but instead formula _ [-21-] {+22+} .
The function is now referred to as " formula _ [-3-] {+1+} of formula _ [-15-] {+16+} " .
and if we want to use the value of formula _ [-3-] {+1+} for formula _ [-15-] {+16+} equal to formula _ [-27-] {+28+} , then we would substitute 2 for formula _ [-15-] {+16+} on both sides of the definition above and write
This notation is more informative than leaving off the independent variable and writing simply ' formula _ [-3-] {+1+} ' , but can be ambiguous since the parentheses can be interpreted as multiplication .
To make it simple , for the function formula _ [-21-] {+22+} , all of the formula _ [-15-] {+16+} values constitute the domain , and all of the values formula _ [-21-] {+22+} ( formula _ [-16-] {+17+} on the x-y plane ) constitute the range .
The value of a function formula _ [-3-] {+1+} depends upon the value of another variable formula _ [-15-] {+16+}
however , that variable could be equal to another function formula _ [-13-] {+14+} , so its value depends on the value of a third variable .
If this is the case , then the first variable is a function formula _ [-14-] {+15+} of the third variable
this function ( formula _ [-14-] {+15+} ) is called the composition of the other two functions ( formula _ [-3-] {+1+} and formula _ [-13-] {+14+} ) .
Here , formula _ [-14-] {+15+} is the composition of formula _ [-3-] {+1+} and formula _ [-13-] {+14+} .
Thus , the expression formula _ [-64-] {+65+} is a composition of functions :
Since the function " [-times-] {+plus+} " equals formula _ [-65-] {+69+} if formula _ [-66-] {+70+} and formula _ [-67-] {+71+} , then
Since the function " [-times-] {+plus+} " equals formula _ [-66-] {+70+} if formula _ [-67-] {+71+} and formula _ [-68-] {+72+} , then
However , this is a horizontal dilation by formula _ [-78-] {+79+} because the distance to the y-axis has been halved .
Note that formula _ [-80-] {+81+} must always be unbounded ( that is , have no inclusive bracket , but instead have an exclusive parentheses ) .
This is because formula _ [-80-] {+81+} is not a number , and therefore cannot be in our set .
formula _ [-80-] {+81+} is really just a symbol that makes things easier to write , like the intervals above.Note : " ( " is also denoted by " ] " , and " ) " by " [ " , i.e. , ( a , b ) is the same as ] a , b [ , and [ a , b ) is [ a , b [ .
then formula _ [-21-] {+22+} is only defined for values of formula _ [-15-] {+16+} between formula _ [-86-] {+87+} and formula _ [-87-] {+88+} , because the square root function is not defined ( in real numbers ) for negative values .
Thus , the domain , in interval notation , is formula _ [-88-] {+89+} .
then formula _ [-21-] {+22+} can only equal values in the interval from formula _ [-92-] {+93+} to formula _ [-87-] {+88+} .
Thus , the range of formula _ [-3-] {+1+} is formula _ [-95-] {+96+} .
A function formula _ [-21-] {+22+} is one-to-one ( or less commonly injective ) if , for every value of formula _ [-3-] {+1+} , there is only one value of formula _ [-15-] {+16+} that corresponds to that value of formula _ [-3-] {+1+} .
For instance , the function formula _ [-83-] {+84+} is not one-to-one , because both formula _ [-101-] {+102+} and formula _ [-102-] {+103+} result in formula _ [-103-] {+104+} .
However , the function formula _ [-104-] {+105+} is one-to-one because for every possible value of formula _ [-21-] {+22+} , there is exactly one corresponding value of formula _ [-15-] {+16+} .
Any function that looks like formula _ [-107-] {+108+} , where formula _ [-108-] {+109+} , is one-to-one .
Note that if you have a one-to-one function and translates / dilates it , it remains one-to-one ( Of course you can 't multiply formula _ [-15-] {+16+} or formula _ [-3-] {+1+} by a zero factor ) .
Function formula _ [-21-] {+22+} has an inverse function " if and only if " formula _ [-21-] {+22+} is one-to-one .
For formula _ [-21-] {+22+} and formula _ [-114-] {+115+} such that formula _ [-114-] {+115+} is the inverse function of formula _ [-21-] {+22+} :
For example , the inverse of formula _ [-104-] {+105+} is formula _ [-119-] {+120+} .
The function formula _ [-83-] {+84+} has no inverse .
The inverse function of formula _ [-3-] {+1+} is denoted as formula _ [-122-] {+123+} .
The inverse of a function formula _ [-122-] {+123+} is defined as the function that follows this rule
To determine formula _ [-122-] {+123+} when given a function f , substitute formula _ [-122-] {+123+} for formula _ [-15-] {+16+} and substitute formula _ [-15-] {+16+} for formula _ [-21-] {+22+} .
Then solve for formula _ [-122-] {+123+} , provided that it is also a function .
Example : Given formula _ [-131-] {+132+} , find formula _ [-122-] {+123+} .
To check your work , confirm that formula _ [-142-] {+143+} :
A graph is a set of points in the Cartesian plane , where each point ( formula _ [-15-] {+16+} , formula _ [-16-] {+17+} ) indicates that formula _ [-148-] {+149+} .
In other words , a graph uses the position of a point in one direction ( the " vertical-axis " or " y-axis " ) to indicate the value of formula _ [-3-] {+1+} for a position of the point in the other direction ( the " horizontal-axis " or " x-axis " ) .
Functions may be graphed by finding the value of formula _ [-3-] {+1+} for various formula _ [-15-] {+16+} and plotting the points ( formula _ [-15-] {+16+} , formula _ [-21-] {+22+} ) in a Cartesian plane .
The graph of formula _ [-3-] {+1+} is a single line , passing through ( formula _ [-92-] {+93+} , formula _ [-92-] {+93+} ) and formula _ [-158-] {+159+} .

If any vertical line ever touches the [-relation for-] {+graph at+} more than one [-value-] {+point+} , then the [-expression-] {+equation+} is not a function
Thus , the expression formula _ [-69-] {+74+} is a composition of functions :
Since the function " times " equals formula _ [-70-] {+75+} if formula _ [-71-] {+76+} and formula _ [-72-] {+77+} , then
Since the function " plus " equals formula _ [-74-] {+79+} if formula _ [-75-] {+80+} and formula _ [-76-] {+81+} , then
However , this is a horizontal dilation by formula _ [-83-] {+88+} because the distance to the y-axis has been halved .
Note that formula _ [-85-] {+90+} must always be unbounded ( that is , have no inclusive bracket , but instead have an exclusive parentheses ) .
This is because formula _ [-85-] {+90+} is not a number , and therefore cannot be in our set .
formula _ [-85-] {+90+} is really just a symbol that makes things easier to write , like the intervals above.Note : " ( " is also denoted by " ] " , and " ) " by " [ " , i.e. , ( a , b ) is the same as ] a , b [ , and [ a , b ) is [ a , b [ .
then formula _ 26 is only defined for values of formula _ 5 between formula _ [-91-] {+96+} and formula _ [-92-] {+97+} , because the square root function is not defined ( in real numbers ) for negative values .
Thus , the domain , in interval notation , is formula _ [-93-] {+98+} .
then formula _ 26 can only equal values in the interval from formula _ [-97-] {+102+} to formula _ [-92-] {+97+} .
Thus , the range of formula _ 1 is formula _ [-100-] {+105+} .
For instance , the function formula _ [-88-] {+93+} is not one-to-one , because both formula _ [-106-] {+111+} and formula _ [-107-] {+112+} result in formula _ [-108-] {+113+} .
However , the function formula _ [-109-] {+114+} is one-to-one because for every possible value of formula _ 26 , there is exactly one corresponding value of formula _ 5 .
Any function that looks like formula _ [-112-] {+117+} , where formula _ [-113-] {+118+} , is one-to-one .

They consist of multiplying , dividing , adding or subtracting constants to either the [-argument-] {+input+} or the output .
Multiplying by a constant is {+called+} [-known as Dilation-] {+dilation+} and adding a constant is called [-Translation-] {+translation+} .
Translations and [-Dilations-] {+dilations+} can be either horizontal or vertical .
[-However-] {+Thus+} , this is a horizontal dilation by formula _ 88 because the distance to the y-axis has been halved .

If I add one to [-x-] {+formula _ 5+} , I add two to the input of [-the function-] {+formula _ 1+} , so it will now change twice as quickly .
Thus , this is a horizontal dilation by formula _ [-88-] {+90+} because the distance to the {+formula _+} [-y-axis-] {+21-axis+} has been halved .
The output represents the distance from the {+formula _+} [-x-axis-] {+5-axis+} , so in effect , you have made the graph of the function ' taller ' .
Here are a few basic examples where [-a-] {+formula _ 94+} is any positive constant :
Note that formula _ [-90-] {+95+} must always be unbounded ( that is , have no inclusive bracket , but instead have an exclusive parentheses ) .
This is because formula _ [-90-] {+95+} is not a number , and therefore cannot be in our set .
formula _ [-90-] {+95+} is really just a symbol that makes things easier to write , like the intervals above.Note : " ( " is also denoted by " ] " , and " ) " by " [ " , i.e. , ( a , b ) is the same as ] a , b [ , and [ a , b ) is [ a , b [ .
then formula _ 26 is only defined for values of formula _ 5 between formula _ [-96-] {+101+} and formula _ [-97-] {+102+} , because the square root function is not defined ( in real numbers ) for negative values .
Thus , the domain , in interval notation , is formula _ [-98-] {+103+} .
then formula _ 26 can only equal values in the interval from formula _ [-102-] {+107+} to formula _ [-97-] {+102+} .
Thus , the range of formula _ 1 is formula _ [-105-] {+110+} .
For instance , the function formula _ [-93-] {+98+} is not one-to-one , because both formula _ [-111-] {+116+} and formula _ [-112-] {+117+} result in formula _ [-113-] {+118+} .
However , the function formula _ [-114-] {+119+} is one-to-one because for every possible value of formula _ 26 , there is exactly one corresponding value of formula _ 5 .
Any function that looks like formula _ [-117-] {+122+} , where formula _ [-118-] {+123+} , is one-to-one .
For formula _ 26 and formula _ [-124-] {+129+} such that formula _ [-124-] {+129+} is the inverse function of formula _ 26 :
For example , the inverse of formula _ [-114-] {+119+} is formula _ [-129-] {+134+} .
The function formula _ [-93-] {+98+} has no inverse .
The inverse function of formula _ 1 is denoted as formula _ [-132-] {+137+} .
The inverse of a function formula _ [-132-] {+137+} is defined as the function that follows this rule
To determine formula _ [-132-] {+137+} when given a function f , substitute formula _ [-132-] {+137+} for formula _ 5 and substitute formula _ 5 for formula _ 26 .
Then solve for formula _ [-132-] {+137+} , provided that it is also a function .
Example : Given formula _ [-141-] {+146+} , find formula _ [-132-] {+137+} .
Substitute formula _ [-132-] {+137+} for formula _ 5 and substitute formula _ 5 for formula _ 26 . , then solve for formula _ [-132-] {+137+} :
To check your work , confirm that formula _ [-152-] {+157+} :
A graph is a set of points in the Cartesian plane , where each point ( formula _ 5 , formula _ 21 ) indicates that formula _ [-158-] {+163+} .
The graph of formula _ 1 is a single line , passing through ( formula _ [-102-] {+107+} , formula _ [-102-] {+107+} ) and formula _ [-168-] {+173+} .
The above laws are true for all formula _ [-180-] {+94+} , formula _ [-181-] {+186+} , and formula _ [-182-] {+187+} , whether formula _ [-180-] {+94+} , formula _ [-181-] {+186+} , and formula _ [-182-] {+187+} are numbers , variables , functions , or other expressions .

A function is usually written as formula _ [-2-] {+3+} , formula _ [-3-] {+4+} , or something similar - although it doesn 't have to be .
For example , formula _ [-4-] {+5+} tells us :
Note that formula _ [-16-] {+17+} means the value of the dependent variable when formula _ [-17-] {+18+} takes on the value of 3 .
A good way to think of it is the dependent variable formula _ [-18-] {+19+} ' depends ' on the value of the independent variable formula _ [-17-] {+18+} .
This is read as " the value of formula _ [-2-] {+3+} at three is eleven " , or simply " formula _ [-2-] {+3+} of three equals eleven " .
Though there are no strict rules for naming a function , it is standard practice to use the letters formula _ [-2-] {+3+} , formula _ [-3-] {+4+} , and formula _ [-24-] {+46+} to denote functions , and the variable formula _ [-6-] {+1+} to denote an independent variable .
formula _ [-26-] {+2+} is used for both dependent and independent variables .
When discussing or working with a function formula _ [-2-] {+3+} , it 's important to know not only the function , but also its independent variable formula _ [-6-] {+1+} .
Thus , when referring to a function formula _ [-2-] {+3+} , you usually do not write formula _ [-2-] {+3+} , but instead formula _ [-31-] {+53+} .
The function is now referred to as " formula _ [-2-] {+3+} of formula _ [-6-] {+1+} " .
and if we want to use the value of formula _ [-2-] {+3+} for formula _ [-6-] {+1+} equal to formula _ [-37-] {+59+} , then we would substitute 2 for formula _ [-6-] {+1+} on both sides of the definition above and write
This notation is more informative than leaving off the independent variable and writing simply ' formula _ [-2-] {+3+} ' , but can be ambiguous since the parentheses can be misinterpreted as multiplication .
To make it simple , for the function formula _ [-31-] {+53+} , all of the possible formula _ [-6-] {+1+} values constitute the domain , and all of the values formula _ [-31-] {+53+} ( formula _ [-26-] {+2+} on the x-y plane ) constitute the range .
The vertical line test , mentioned in the preceding paragraph , is a systematic test to find out if an equation involving formula _ [-6-] {+1+} and formula _ [-26-] {+2+} can serve as a function ( with formula _ [-6-] {+1+} the independent variable and formula _ [-26-] {+2+} the dependent variable ) .
Simply graph the equation and draw a vertical line through each point of the formula _ [-6-axis-] {+1-axis+} .
The value of a function formula _ [-2-] {+3+} depends upon the value of another variable formula _ [-6-] {+1+}
however , that variable could be equal to another function formula _ [-3-] {+4+} , so its value depends on the value of a third variable .
If this is the case , then the first variable is a function formula _ [-24-] {+46+} of the third variable
this function ( formula _ [-24-] {+46+} ) is called the composition of the other two functions ( formula _ [-2-] {+3+} and formula _ [-3-] {+4+} ) .
Here , formula _ [-24-] {+46+} is the composition of formula _ [-2-] {+3+} and formula _ [-3-] {+4+} and we write formula _ [-74-] {+96+} .
Thus , the expression formula _ [-80-] {+102+} is a composition of functions :
Since the function sine equals formula _ [-82-] {+104+} if formula _ [-83-] {+105+} ,
Since the function square equals formula _ [-85-] {+107+} if formula _ [-83-] {+105+} ,
If I add one to formula _ [-6-] {+1+} , I add two to the input of formula _ [-2-] {+3+} , so it will now change twice as quickly .
Thus , this is a horizontal dilation by formula _ [-95-] {+117+} because the distance to the formula _ [-26-axis-] {+2-axis+} has been halved .
The output represents the distance from the formula _ [-6-axis-] {+1-axis+} , so in effect , you have made the graph of the function ' taller ' .
Here are a few basic examples where formula _ [-99-] {+121+} is any positive constant :
then formula _ [-31-] {+53+} is only defined for values of formula _ [-6-] {+1+} between formula _ [-1-] {+23+} and formula _ [-104-] {+126+} , because the square root function is not defined ( in real numbers ) for negative values .
Thus , the domain , in interval notation , is formula _ [-105-] {+127+} .
then formula _ [-31-] {+53+} can only equal values in the interval from formula _ [-109-] {+131+} to formula _ [-104-] {+126+} .
Thus , the range of formula _ [-2-] {+3+} is formula _ [-112-] {+134+} .
A function formula _ [-31-] {+53+} is one-to-one ( or less commonly injective ) if , for every value of formula _ [-2-] {+3+} , there is only one value of formula _ [-6-] {+1+} that corresponds to that value of formula _ [-2-] {+3+} .
For instance , the function formula _ [-100-] {+122+} is not one-to-one , because both formula _ [-118-] {+140+} and formula _ [-119-] {+141+} result in formula _ [-120-] {+142+} .
However , the function formula _ [-121-] {+143+} is one-to-one , because , for every possible value of formula _ [-31-] {+53+} , there is exactly one corresponding value of formula _ [-6-] {+1+} .
Other examples of one-to-one functions are formula _ [-124-] {+146+} , where formula _ [-125-] {+147+} .
( Of course you can 't multiply formula _ [-6-] {+1+} or formula _ [-2-] {+3+} by a zero factor ) .
Is formula _ [-128-] {+150+} a 1-1 function ? < br > < br >
Therefore by the algebraic 1-1 test , the function formula _ [-137-] {+159+} is 1-1 .
formula _ [-138-] {+160+} is not one-to-one because formula _ [-139-] {+161+} but formula _ [-140-] {+162+} .
We call formula _ [-141-] {+163+} the inverse function of formula _ [-31-] {+53+} if , for all formula _ [-6-] {+1+} :
A function formula _ [-31-] {+53+} has an inverse function if and only if formula _ [-31-] {+53+} is one-to-one .
For example , the inverse of formula _ [-121-] {+143+} is formula _ [-148-] {+170+} .
The function formula _ [-100-] {+122+} has no inverse .
The inverse function of formula _ [-2-] {+3+} is denoted as formula _ [-151-] {+173+} .
Thus , formula _ [-151-] {+173+} is defined as the function that follows this rule
Then solve for formula _ [-151-] {+173+} , provided that it is also a function .
Example : Given formula _ [-161-] {+183+} , find formula _ [-151-] {+173+} .
If formula _ [-2-] {+3+} isn 't one-to-one , then , as we said before , it doesn 't have an inverse .
Example : Given formula _ [-138-] {+160+} , find formula _ [-151-] {+173+} .
[-Then solve-] {+Since there are two possibilities+} for formula _ 151 [-:-] {+, it 's not a function .+}
[-Then solve-] {+Since there are two possibilities+} for formula _ 173 [-:-] {+, it 's not a function .+}
Thus formula _ [-138-] {+160+} doesn 't have an inverse .
For example , we might only know an algebraic expression for formula _ [-31-] {+53+} but not a graph .

Here , formula _ 49 is the composition of formula _ 3 and formula _ 7 and we write formula _ [-99-] {+127+} .
Thus , the expression formula _ [-105-] {+133+} is a composition of functions :
Since the function sine equals formula _ [-107-] {+135+} if formula _ [-108-] {+136+} ,
Since the function square equals formula _ [-110-] {+138+} if formula _ [-108-] {+136+} ,
Thus , this is a horizontal dilation by formula _ [-120-] {+148+} because the distance to the formula _ 2-axis has been halved .
Here are a few basic examples where formula _ [-124-] {+152+} is any positive constant :
then formula _ 56 is only defined for values of formula _ 1 between formula _ 26 and formula _ [-129-] {+157+} , because the square root function is not defined ( in real numbers ) for negative values .
Thus , the domain , in interval notation , is formula _ [-130-] {+158+} .
then formula _ 56 can only equal values in the interval from formula _ [-134-] {+162+} to formula _ [-129-] {+157+} .

formula _ [-163-] {+191+} is not one-to-one because formula _ [-164-] {+192+} but formula _ [-165-] {+193+} .
We call formula _ [-166-] {+194+} the inverse function of formula _ 56 if , for all formula _ 1 :

The function formula _ [-125-] {+153+} has no inverse .
The inverse function of formula _ 3 is denoted as formula _ [-176-] {+204+} .

The tail of vector formula _ 2 is collocated with the head of vector formula _ 1 , and the vector which stretches from the tail of formula _ 1 to the head of {+formula _ 2+} [-< / math > \ mbox { \ bf B } < / math >-] is the sum of formula _ 1 and formula _ 2 , called formula _ 3 in figure 2.1 .
Figure 2.2 : Definition sketch for the angle formula _ [-13-] {+14+} representing the orientation of a two dimensional vector .
The direction of a vector in two dimensions is generally represented by the counterclockwise angle of the vector relative to the formula _ [-16-] {+17+} axis , as shown in figure 2.2 .
where formula _ [-19-] {+20+} is the magnitude of the vector .
A vector magnitude is sometimes represented by absolute value notation : formula _ [-20-] {+21+} .
Notice that the inverse tangent gives a result which is ambiguous relative to adding or subtracting integer multiples of formula _ [-21-] {+22+} .
Thus the quadrant in which the angle lies must be resolved by independently examining the signs of formula _ 5 and formula _ 6 and choosing the appropriate value of formula _ [-13-] {+14+} .
Subtraction of vectors is done similarly , e. g . , if formula _ [-29-] {+30+} , then
One can always construct a unit vector from an ordinary vector by dividing the vector by its length : formula _ [-31-] {+32+} .
Note that formula _ [-32-] {+33+} , formula _ [-33-] {+34+} , and formula _ [-34-] {+35+} are mutually perpendicular .
Any vector can be represented in terms of unit vectors and its Cartesian components : formula _ [-41-] {+42+} .
An alternate way to represent a vector is as list of components : formula _ [-42-] {+43+} .
where formula _ [-13-] {+14+} is the angle between the two vectors .
It is easy to show that this is equivalent to the cosine form of the dot product when the formula _ [-16-] {+17+} axis lies along one of the vectors , as in figure 2.3 .
Notice in particular that formula _ [-49-] {+50+} , while formula _ [-50-] {+51+} and formula _ [-51-] {+52+} .
Thus , formula _ [-52-] {+53+} in this case , which is identical to the form given in equation ( 2.5 ) .
The vector formula _ [-53-] {+54+} has components formula _ [-54-] {+55+} and formula _ [-55-] {+56+} in the unprimed coordinate system and components formula _ [-56-] {+57+} and formula _ [-57-] {+58+} in the primed coordinate system .
To do this , we must show that formula _ [-58-] {+59+} , where the primes indicate components in a coordinate system rotated from the original coordinate system .
Figure 2.4 shows the vector formula _ [-53-] {+54+} resolved in two coordinate systems rotated with respect to each other .
From this figure it is clear that formula _ [-60-] {+61+} .
Focusing on the shaded triangles , we see that formula _ [-61-] {+62+} and formula _ [-62-] {+63+} .
Thus , we find formula _ [-63-] {+64+} .
Similar reasoning shows that formula _ [-64-] {+65+} .
[-Substituting these and using the trigonometric identity-] formula _ [-65 results in-] {+66 formula _ 67 formula _ 68+}
[-Substituting these and using the trigonometric identity-] formula _ {+67+} [-66 results in-]
Since wave fronts are lines or surfaces of constant phase , the equation defining a wave front is simply formula _ [-75-] {+72+} .
In the two dimensional case we simply set formula _ [-76-] {+73+} .
Therefore , a wavefront , or line of constant phase formula _ [-77-] {+74+} in two dimensions is defined by the equation
This can be easily solved for formula _ [-36-] {+37+} to obtain the slope and intercept of the wavefront in two dimensions .
As for one dimensional waves , the time evolution of the wave is obtained by adding a term formula _ [-80-] {+77+} to the phase of the wave .
The form of this function , formula _ [-82-] {+79+} , which as in the one dimensional case is called the " dispersion relation " , contains information about the physical behavior of the wave .
This is possible because frequency depends only on wave vector magnitude formula _ [-92-] {+89+} for the first two examples , and only on wave vector direction formula _ [-13-] {+14+} for the third .
We superimpose two plane waves with wave vectors formula _ [-94-] {+91+} and formula _ [-95-] {+92+} .
The lengths of the wave vectors in both cases are formula _ [-96-] {+93+} :
If formula _ [-98-] {+95+} , then both waves are moving approximately in the formula _ [-36-] {+37+} direction .
The components formula _ [-100-] {+97+} and formula _ [-101-] {+98+} of one of the wave vectors are shown .
This is in the form of a sine wave moving in the formula _ [-36-] {+37+} direction with phase speed formula _ [-104-] {+101+} and wavenumber formula _ [-101-] {+98+} , modulated in the formula _ [-16-] {+17+} direction by a cosine function .
The distance formula _ [-107-] {+104+} between regions of destructive interference in the formula _ [-16-] {+17+} direction tells us the width of the resulting beams , and is given by formula _ [-109-] {+106+} , so that
Thus , the smaller formula _ [-100-] {+97+} , the greater is the beam diameter .
The wave vectors of the two waves are formula _ [-112-] {+109+} .
Comparison with the {+formula+} [-< / math > \ Delta k-] _ {+122+} [-x / \ Delta k _ y < / math >-] slope of the lines of constructive interference indicates that this is so .
We call {+formula+} [-< / math > \ alpha-] _ {+141+} [-{ max } < / math >-] the " spreading angle " .
However , for {+formula _ 150+} [-< / math > y > 0 < / math >-] the wave spreads into a broad semicircular pattern .
We conclude that a superposition of plane waves with wave vectors spread narrowly about a central wave vector which points in the {+formula _ 37+} [-< / math > y < / math >-] direction ( as in figure 2.14 ) produces a beam which is initially broad in {+formula _ 17+} [-< / math > x < / math >-] but for which the breadth increases only slightly with increasing {+formula _ 37+} [-< / math > y < / math >-] .
However , a superposition of plane waves with wave vectors spread more broadly ( as in figure 2.13 ) produces a beam which is initially narrow in {+formula _ 17+} [-< / math > x < / math >-] but which rapidly increases in width as {+formula _ 37+} [-< / math > y < / math >-] increases .
The relationship between the spreading angle {+formula+} [-< / math > \ alpha-] _ {+141+} [-{ max } < / math >-] and the initial breadth of the beam is made more understandable by comparison with the results for the two-wave superposition discussed at the beginning of this section .
As indicated by equation ( 2.17 ) , large values of {+formula+} [-< / math > k-] _ {+165+} [-x < / math >-] , and hence {+formula _ 166+} [-< / math > \ alpha < / math >-] , are associated with small wave packet dimensions in the {+formula _ 17+} [-< / math > x < / math >-] direction and vice versa .
The superposition of two waves doesn 't capture the subsequent spread of the beam which occurs when many waves are superimposed , but it does lead to a rough quantitative relationship between {+formula+} [-< / math > \ alpha-] _ {+141+} [-{ max } < / math >-] ( which is just {+formula+} [-< / math > \ tan ^ { -1 } ( k-] _ {+169+} [-x / k _ y ) < / math >-] in the two wave case ) and the initial breadth of the beam .
Thus , we can find the approximate spreading angle from the wavelength of the wave {+formula _ 174+} [-< / math > \ lambda < / math >-] and the initial breadth of the beam {+formula _ 104+} [-< / math > w < / math >-] :
Imagine a plane wave of wavelength {+formula _ 174+} [-< / math > \ lambda < / math >-] impingent on a barrier with a slit or opening of width {+formula _ 104+} [-< / math > w < / math >-] .
Equation ( 2.22 ) gives us an approximate quantitative result for the spreading angle if {+formula _ 104+} [-< / math > w < / math >-] is interpreted as the width of the slit .
The spreading angle {+formula+} [-< / math > \ alpha-] _ {+141+} [-{ max } < / math >-] is given by equation ( 2.22 ) , and the telescope cannot resolve objects with an angular separation less than {+formula+} [-< / math > \ alpha-] _ {+141+} [-{ max } < / math >-] .
Replacing {+formula _ 104+} [-< / math > w < / math >-] with the diameter of the lens or mirror in equation ( 2.22 ) thus yields the telescope 's angular resolution .
Light passing through slit B travels an extra distance to the screen equal to {+formula _ 186+} [-< / math > d \ sin \ theta < / math >-] compared to light passing through slit A.
Let us now imagine a plane sine wave normally impingent on a screen with two narrow slits spaced by a distance {+formula _ 187+} [-< / math > d < / math >-] , as shown in figure 2.16 .
If {+formula+} [-< / math > L-] _ {+192+} [-0 » d < / math >-] , the lines {+formula+} [-< / math > L-] _ {+193+} [-1 < / math >-] and {+formula+} [-< / math > L-] _ {+194+} [-2 < / math >-] are nearly parallel , which means that the narrow end of the dark triangle in figure 2.16 has an opening angle of {+formula _ 14+} [-< / math > \ theta < / math >-] .
[-Substitution of this into the above equation shows that constructive-] {+Destructive+} interference occurs when {+< / math > m < / math > is an integer plus < / math > 1 / 2 < / math > .+}
[-Substitution of this into the above equation shows that constructive-] {+Destructive+} interference occurs when {+formula _ 119 is an integer plus formula _ 199 .+}
The integer {+formula _ 119+} [-< / math > m < / math >-] is called the " interference order " and is the number of wavelengths by which the two paths differ .
Since the angular spacing {+formula _ 201+} [-< / math > \ Delta \ theta < / math >-] of interference peaks in the two slit case depends on the wavelength of the incident wave , the two slit system can be used as a crude device to distinguish between the wavelengths of different components of a non-sinusoidal wave impingent on the slits .
However , if more slits are added , maintaining a uniform spacing {+formula _ 187+} [-< / math > d < / math >-] between slits , we obtain a more sophisticated device for distinguishing beam components .
The width of the peaks is actually related to the overall width of the grating , {+formula _ 203+} [-< / math > w = nd < / math >-] , where {+formula _ 204+} [-< / math > n < / math >-] is the number of slits .
Thinking of this width as the dimension of large single slit , the single slit equation , {+formula+} [-< / math > \ alpha-] _ {+205+} [-{ max } = \ lambda / ( 2w ) < / math >-] , tells us the angular width of the peaks .
Thus , the fractional difference between wavelengths which can be distinuished by a diffraction grating depends solely on the interference order {+formula _ 119+} [-< / math > m < / math >-] and the number of slits {+formula _ 204+} [-< / math > n < / math >-] in the grating :

This approach uses the concept of invariance [-,-] to explore the types of coordinate systems that are required to provide a full physical description of the location and extent of things .
It seems that , provided all the directions in which a thing can be tilted or arranged [-,-] are represented within a coordinate system , then the coordinate system can fully represent the length of a thing .
they extend between one place and time and another place and time , so the velocity of the thing that travels along the interval is already determined {+for a given observer+} .
The space-time interval , formula _ [-15-] {+16+} , is invariant .
{+So , if John sees Bill measure a time interval of 1 second ( formula _ 21 ) between two ticks of a clock that is at rest in+} Bill 's {+frame ( modeled by the condition+} formula _ [-16 equals-] {+22 ) ,+} John [-'s-] {+will find that his own clock measures between these same ticks an interval+} formula _ [-16 so :-] {+23 , called coordinate time , which is greater than one second .+}

If the length of a rod at rest on Bill 's planet is formula _ [-24-] {+25+} , then we call this quantity the proper length of the rod .

This effect is known as [-"-] Relativistic Phase [-"-] or the [-"-] Relativity of Simultaneity [-"-] .

If light were travelling towards the origin {+then+} the Light Cone Equation would describe {+the+} position and time of emission of all those photons that could be at the origin at a particular instant .
The assumption that the speed of light is the maximum velocity for all communications is neither inherent in nor required by four dimensional geometry although the speed of light {+is indeed+} [-does seem to be-] the maximum velocity for objects if the principle of causality is to be preserved by physical theories ( ie : that causes precede effects ) .

This is one of the most important results of Special Relativity and [-is often neglected-] {+should be thoroughly understood+} by students .
The net effect of the four-dimensional universe is that observers who are in motion relative to you seem to have time coordinates that lean over in the direction of motion [-,-] and consider things to be simultaneous [-,-] that are not simultaneous for you .

The universal constant , " c " , is known for historical reasons as the " speed of light {+in a vacuum+} " .
There are now few physicists who believe that light {+in a vacuum+} does not propagate at " c " .

There are three things you can do on [-Wikipedia-] {+Wikibooks+} .
Go to the Main Page , find a [-subject-] {+Wikibook+} that looks interesting , and start exploring .
If you read something , and you like it , why not drop a note on the [-article 's-] {+' s+} talk page {+|+} ?
Anyone can edit pages in [-Wikipedia-] {+Wikibooks+} .
One of the best ways to start helping is just to use [-Wikipedia-] {+Wikibooks+} as you would any other [-encyclopedia-] {+library+} , but when you spot a problem - a spelling mistake , perhaps , or an unclear sentence , then go in and fix it .
The GFDL ensures that [-Wikipedia-] {+Wikibooks+} will remain freely distributable forever .
This means that [-articles-] {+modules and Wikibooks+} , even on controversial topics , should be unbiased .
